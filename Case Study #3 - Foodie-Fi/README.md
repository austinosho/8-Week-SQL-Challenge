## Introduction
Danny identified a market opportunity for a subscription-based service focused exclusively on food-related content. To address this gap, he launched Foodie-Fi in 2020 with a group of talented friends. Foodie-Fi offers monthly and annual subscriptions, providing customers with unlimited access to a vast collection of exclusive cooking shows and food videos from around the world.
Danny's goal for Foodie-Fi is to make all business decisions based on data. Therefore, he has designed the service with a strong data-driven approach to guide future investments and new features. This case study examines subscription data to answer key business questions and provides insights into the company's performance and customer behavior. The analysis is based on two main tables within the `foodie_fi` database schema, with an additional challenge to create a new table to support the Foodie-Fi team‚Äôs data needs.

## Case Study Questions and Solution

## A. Customer Journey

**Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!**
````sql
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  p.plan_id, 
  p.plan_name,  
  s.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.plans p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s
  ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
````

**Result:**
| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | start_date               |
